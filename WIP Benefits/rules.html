    <title>Rules</title>

<h2>Important Notices</h2>
<p>- Please note some of these rules may also apply to other locations such as Twitch or YouTube, so when watching my content please know you may be expected to follow the same rules posted here.</p>
<p>- Please note the number beside the rules listed. These numbers correlate with the severity of the rule. In an example, if you break a rule with a 5 you will be more heavily punished than a rule with a 1.</p>

<h2>General Rules</h2>
<p>- [<strong>1-5</strong>] Do your best to follow the rules set by Discord. This means following the [<strong>ToS</strong>](https://dis.gd/ToS) and [<strong>Guidelines</strong>](https://dis.gd/guidelines).</p>
<p>- [<strong>1</strong>] Keep the chats friendly, if you need to debate go over to #debates.</p>
<p>- [<strong>1</strong>] Don't spoil things. For Discord If you are discussing an event in a game or something that may include spoilers, use the spoiler feature by enclosing your messages in <code>||</code>. An example of following this rule is the following - <code>||John Doe ends up dying at the end of the game||</code>.</p>
<p>- [<strong>1-3</strong>] Don't promote yourself, I plan to make a channel for this soon.</p>

<h2>Discussion Rules</h2>
<p>- [<strong>1-3</strong>] Respect other people's opinions. We are human; we don't agree with everything that we talk about.</p>
<p>- [<strong>1-2</strong>] Don't discuss religious beliefs in a forceful way. This means don't push your religion on other people.</p>
<p>- [<strong>1-2</strong>] If someone asks you to stop discussing religious topics, please do so.</p>
<p>- [<strong>1-3</strong>] If someone asks you to stop discussing other sensitive topics, please do so. (I will be changing this to be more specific in the future.)</p>

<h2>Earn, Don't Demand Rules</h2>
<p>- [<strong>1-2</strong>] Don't beg for roles, tiers, perms, or other things like this. Tiers aren't given away for free, and perms like sending messages in channels are unlocked by talking and engaging in the server and unlocking levels.</p>
<p>- [<strong>1-2</strong>] Don't beg to join sessions or games with me (or other people). Personally, I'm not comfortable with streaming content with people I'm unfamiliar with. This is due to me being a bit antisocial, but mostly because I see this as a career and I can't risk something happening on stream that may damage my reputation.</p>

<h2>We Don't Tolerate Rules</h2>
<p>- [<strong>3-5</strong>] We don't tolerate bullying or making fun of certain things (such as, but not limited to, sexual orientation). When this rule is broken involving things like sexual orientation, you will most likely get banned. <strong>I accept people for who they are, I do not tolerate people making fun of someone's sexual orientation or hobbies.</strong> This rule is formed this way to let you know I accept people that are part of the LGBTQ community, people that are furries, therians, etc.</p>
<p>- [<strong>5</strong>] If you chargeback on a donation or anything similar you will immediately be banned from all platforms. This is NOT tolerated whatsoever. Charging back not only is a scummy thing to do, but it also takes a chargeback fee from me as well.</p>

<h2>"Legal Sounding" Rules</h2>
<p>- By being a member of this server, you understand rules and consequences can change at <strong>anytime</strong> without me needing to ensure you are aware of them. It is up to you to make sure you are following rules-- old or new. You are responsible for following rules, including newly implemented rules as well.</p>
<p>- You are allowed to appeal all bans by going to [<strong>this form</strong>](https://forms.gle/TFmh8s4TxM6S6kzd7). It will be provided to you during bans by a bot or within the ban message for you to get access to the page.</p>
<p>- If you face consequences such as being banned from one platform, you may also be banned from other platforms. For example, if you are found harassing members of the community on Discord and get banned, we may also decide to ban you from Twitch and YouTube as well.</p>
